    OSI seven layers
    TCP 4 layers
    Layer 4 is ports
    UDP 69
    Layer 1 bit
    layer 2 frame
    layer 3 packet
    layer 4 segment or datagram
    Layer 1 devices hubs and repeaters
    Layer 2 switches
    Layer 3 routers
    Router icon each interface is on its own subnet.
    routers connect different networks together. routing table if not defualt route ...

    after ssh is configures use ssh
    SDN
    Layer 2 vs layer 3 switches
    Layer 2 looks only at Mac Addresses.
    Layer 3 switches can also route.
    Switches have switchports  rj54 or small form factor plauggable for fiber optics.
    SFP ports require SFP trancievers
    All ports start out as access ports but we can turn them into trunk ports
    all ports live in vlan 1
    1002-1005 are reserved
    show version
    Layer 2 switches only let you talk to people in you vlan.
    Layer 2 switches do no touting.
    default gateway must be an address on your subnet.
    management address so you can ssh into the switches
    SVI ip address
    Layer 3 switches can do some routing 
    multi-layer switch.
    source mac and destination mac are in the same  vlan
    vlan to vlan has to cross layer 3
    forward packets based on IP address.
    inter-VLAN routing
    arp to find the gateway they find the router.
    Firewall and IPS stuff
    DMZ
    WWW->DMZ->internal
    WWW/DNS/SMTP
    Firewalls filter packest 
    Next-gen firewalls filter packets based on content.
    ACLs on routers interfaces.
    match nothing means you get denied
    stateful ...
    Static firewall is just and ACL and a list of rules.
    Stateful firewalls like windows firewall let you establish an outgoing connections inspects traffic and allwos response
    context based access control 
    Next Generation Firewalls.
    Intrusion prevention  systems
    Intrusion detection systems monitor and alert
    Intrusion prevention can modify ACLs based on behavior.
    HIPS vs HIDS

    signature based
    anomlay based

    Endpoint is the thing that we need to play into the switch or access point.
    Stay off the wireless unless you can authenticate.
    endpoints are typically the most vulnerable of components.
    BYOD are dangerous
    Don't let it on your network
    If you have to let BYODs on make sure their security is curent.
