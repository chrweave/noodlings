    Broadcast to every host on subnet
    multicast to some hosts.
    224.x.x.x - 239.x.x.x is a multicast
    Some multicasts are proprietary.
    rfc 1918 give private address since we are running out of public addresses.

    BACK TO V6 ...
    128 bits
    32 hex charcters
    8 blocks of 16 bits.
    prefix or prefix mask are CIDR notation.
    Leading zeros can be dropped; trailing zeros cannot for IPv6 addresses.
    DNS resolves names to addresses.
    double colons mean all zeros sparsed.
    Every interface has two v6 addresses one like fe80::9971:4fc1:d208:585a/64 isn LINK LOCAL.
    router(config)# ipv6 unicast-routing
    makes a v4 router forward v6 traffic.
    all of your major devices should have a static address.
    router(config)# interface gigabitethernet0/0
    router(config)# ipv6 address 2001:D88:1111:1::1/64
    eui-64 make your mac address the client.
    cuts your MAC address in half and puts fffe in the middle.
    router(config-if)#ipvy6 address dhcp (don't do this to a router or a switch).
    Link Local address TTL=1;
    it can't get off its subnet.
    used for mulitcast discovery.
    give it a static ip or make it a dhcp client.
    SLAAC address mask and gateway.
    StateLess Address AutoConfig.
    Hey! I'm looking for a router.
    take network address and slap on your mac and you have an auto configured ipv6.
    You also need to DNS server address.
    router(config-if):ipv6 address autoconfig
    Get newtork from router and EUI-64 your MAC on it.
    Device that answered becomes your default gateway.
    link local address is good for multicasting.
    IPv6 does not facilitate broadcast; only multicast.
    2000::/3 Through 3fff::/3 Global unicast 
    fc00::/7 - fdff::/7
    link locals fe8::/10 - febf::/10
    ff00::/8 frough ffff::/8 Multicast
    Anycast is like a multicast.
    Connect to the "closest"
    Multicast means to a group.
