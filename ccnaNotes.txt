SWITCHING CONCEPTS
    L2 Switches pass traffic between hosts on the same networking.
    Learn MAC addresses
    Read source MAC from port.
    Fortward frame to destination MAC if known
    Flood otherwise.
    ARP for you ... now I know your MAC.
    show MAC address table
    Computer addressable memory  CAM table
    learns addresses across a trunk
    Default aging is 5 minutes
    after a MAC ages out switch floods
    After receipt, frame ttl is reset.
    if I know the destination MAC I send it there.
    else, I flood the vlan.
    except for the source port.
    Switch#sho vlan brief
    each vlan acts as a differnet network
    add a little bit of security
    vlan to vlan has to cross layer three.
    vlan is a broadcast domain.
    every vlan is a differnet vroadcast domain.
    when you make more vlans, you make more broadcast domains.
    every vlan has its own subnet address.
    layer 3 switches support vlan to vlan traffic
    switchport mode access
    configure vlans and troubleshoot
    SW1(config)#vlan 2
    SW1(config-vlan)#name eekster

    trunk ports gig ports

    subinterfaces use 802.1q

    this allows inter vlan traffic.
    ROAS router on a stick
    .1q changes the frame so that target switch knows what vlan the frame originated from.
    DA SA (802.1q tag) type/len data FCS
    native vlan is vlan 1
    it is where the untagged frames go.
    you can change that.
    switchport trunk native vlan 99
    switchport trunk native vlan 55
    spanning tree runs in native vlan
    native vlans better match over trunk cable.
    Double tagging 
    don't use vlan 1
    match native vlans.
    Spanning tree stops layer two loops.
    if native vlans do not match, it kills spanning tree.

5.6 Configure and verify ACLs
    inbound or outbound packet filter
    a list of permit and deny statements 
    read from top down.
    default deny
    must include one permit.
    ACL is applied to each interface.
    if not permitted explicitly it is denied.
    ACLs can have numbers or names
    Standard ACLS have 1-99 1300-1999
    Match source ip address.
    these look at layer 2
    Extended ACLs 100-199 2000-2999
    looks at layer 3 or 4
    (config)# access-list 1 permit 10.1.1.1 
    (config)# access-list 1 deny 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255 (inverted mask)
    default deny any any
    order matters
    Named ACL NACL
    (config)# ip access-list standard barney
    (config-std-nacl)# permit 10.1.2.2
    (config-std-nacl)# deny 10.1.2.0 0.0.0.255 ...
    direction matters
    linked must be correfct
    Extended ... layer 3 filter not only on layer 3 source but also destination
    Nacls must include keyword 
    show access-list
    Applying ACL
    Build them at global
    go to interface
    (config-if)#ip access-group 10 in
    apply acls to vty lines
    use access class.
    (config-if)# access class 1 in
    Standards go nearer to destination
    extendeds go nearer to source becuase they are moe specific.

    DHCP snooping
    dynamic ARP inspection
    port security
    DHCP snooping knows the port, MAC address, and IP address, of the trusted DHCP server.
    Dynamic ARP Inspection
    DHCP binding database
    use the same database to filter invalid arps
    stops arp poisoning MIM attacks.
    Port security is a MAC address filter for each port.
    disables ports if two mac addresses are learned.
    Protect 
    Restrict
    Shutdown
    Portfast access ports are transitioned to forwarding
    BPDU guard must be in place.
    DTP shoule be disabled.
    change access port mode to administrative access.
    stitchport nonnegotiate
    no DTP ever would be a good command but it does not exist.
    802.1x port based security.
    not port security
    means you need to authenticate to the switch in order to use the port.
    gimme your certificate.
    EAP massage with certificate to RADIUS server which is a member of your domain.
    not all switches are 802.1x compliant.
    hot wall jack cannot be used by eevile laptops.
    active directory integrated hierarchy 
    do it with domain machines.

    one port for DHCP server can be made trusted.
    no rogue dhcp servers handing out addresses.
    Dynammic Arp Inspection
    bindings database of trusted DHCP and MAC addresses.
    IP-Source Guard
    make sure that ip address do not oddly hop ports.
    must have DHCP server integrated.
    enalbe snooping on at least one vlan
    make sure that the DHCP server's port is strusted.
    all ports are untrusted unless designated as truted.
    (config)# ip dhcp snooping ! Eanble DHCP snooping
    (config)# ip dhcp snooping vlan 10
    (config)# interface F1/0/24
    (config-if)# ip dhcp snooping trust
    (config-if)# ip dhcp snooping database tftp://10.1.1.1/direfcotry/file
    (config-if)# ex
    (config)# sh ip dhcp snooping binding
    default lease duration is one day.
    Stop MIM attack through arpn piosoning using DAI.
    use the bindings database
    (config)# ip arp inspection vlan 10
    (config)# interface F1/0/24
    (config-if)# arp inspection trust
    (config-if)# ex
5.7 Port Security
    MAC filter.
    limits number of macs learned.
    stops multiple plugging.
    it also prevents a learned MAC address fromm being learned on another port.
    (config-if)# switchport port-security
    default mode is to shutn the port down.
    Protect Restrict Shutdown
    statically assign mac address
    switchport port-security mac-address (MAC)
    easy to beat a MAC filter 
    make them authenticate 802.1X
    Use teh MAC address of the Kiosk
    Spoof the MAC
    Make them authenticate 802.1x
    Port Security sticky MAC address
    Alternative to statically added MACs
    enable sticky 
    the MACs end up in your configuration.
    They do not get forgotten after not talk.
    this will be the only MAC address allowed in the port.
    (config)#switchport port-security mac-address sticky
    (config-if)#switchport port-security maximum 2
    Protect drop it
    Restrict drop it and log it
    Shutdown drop it log it disale the port. (default)
    err-diable recovery feature
    (config)#errdisable cause psecure-violation
    (config)#errdisable recovery 300
5.8 differnentiate AAA concepts
    Authentication who aer you
    Authoriztions We'll allow you to do what?
    Accounting We watch what you do.
    (config)#aaa new-model
    (config)#tacacs-server host 50.50.4.101
    (config)#tacacs-server key gobbledygobbledy
    (config)#aaa authentication login defualt local enable
    (config)#aaa authentication login defualt MY-List-1 tacacs local enable
    (config)#aaa authorization commands 1 TAC1 group tacacs+ local
    (config)#aaa authorization commands 15 TAC1 group tacacs+ local
    (config)#aaa accounting commands 1 TAC-act1
    (config)#aaa accounting commands 15 TAC-act15
    Authorize stuff for levels 2-14.
    #debug aaa authentication
    Compare TACACS+ and RADIUS
    RADIUS uses UDP open standard
    port 1812 &1813 
    SSID cloaking
    If you don't adverstise your ssid people can't see it.
    allow the beacon frame to be hidden.
    MAC filter is a MAC filter.
    Do not WEP
