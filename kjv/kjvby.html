We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,  <span class="anchor">Since </span>we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints,  For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, <span class="anchor">whereof </span>ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;  Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it <span class="anchor">doth </span>also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:  As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for <span class="anchor">you </span>a faithful minister of Christ;  Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.  For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease <span class="anchor">to </span>pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;  That ye might walk worthy of the <span class="anchor">Lord </span>unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;  Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering <span class="anchor">with </span>joyfulness;  Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:  Who hath delivered us from the power <span class="anchor">of </span>darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:  In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:  Who is the image <span class="anchor">of </span>the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:  For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be <span class="anchor">thrones, </span>or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:  And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.  And he <span class="anchor">is </span>the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.  For it pleased the Father <span class="anchor">that </span>in him should all fulness dwell;  And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they <span class="anchor">be </span>things in earth, or things in heaven.  And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled  In the body <span class="anchor">of </span>his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:  If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from <span class="anchor">the </span>hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;  Who now rejoice in <span class="anchor">my </span>sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body&apos;s sake, which is the church:  Whereof I am made <span class="anchor">a </span>minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;  Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and <span class="anchor">from </span>generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:  To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is <span class="anchor">Christ </span>in you, the hope of glory:  Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:  <span class="anchor">Whereunto </span>I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.</p><h2 id="chapter2">Chapter 2</h2><p> For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the <span class="anchor">flesh; </span> That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and <span class="anchor">of </span>the Father, and of Christ;  In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.  And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words. <span class="anchor"> </span>For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.  As <span class="anchor">ye </span>have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him:  Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein <span class="anchor">with </span>thanksgiving.  Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.  For in <span class="anchor">him </span>dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.  And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:  In whom also ye are circumcised <span class="anchor">with </span>the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:  Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are <span class="anchor">risen </span>with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.  And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, <span class="anchor">hath </span>he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;  Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of <span class="anchor">the </span>way, nailing it to his cross;  And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.  Let no man therefore judge <span class="anchor">you </span>in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:  Which are a shadow of things to come; but <span class="anchor">the </span>body is of Christ.  Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly <span class="anchor">puffed </span>up by his fleshly mind,  And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of <span class="anchor">God. </span> Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,  (Touch not; taste not; <span class="anchor">handle </span>not;  Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?  Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, <span class="anchor">and </span>neglecting of the body: not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.</p><h2 id="chapter3">Chapter 3</h2><p> If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.  Set your affection on things above, not <span class="anchor">on </span>things on the earth.  For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.  When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also <span class="anchor">appear </span>with him in glory.  Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:  For which things&apos; sake the <span class="anchor">wrath </span>of God cometh on the children of disobedience:  In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.  But now ye also put off all these; <span class="anchor">anger, </span>wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.  Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;  And have put <span class="anchor">on </span>the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:  Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor <span class="anchor">free: </span>but Christ is all, and in all.  Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;  Forbearing one <span class="anchor">another, </span>and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.  And above all these things put on charity, which <span class="anchor">is </span>the bond of perfectness.  And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.  Let <span class="anchor">the </span>word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. <span class="anchor"> </span>And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.  Wives, submit yourselves unto <span class="anchor">your </span>own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.  Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.  Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is <span class="anchor">well </span>pleasing unto the Lord.  Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.  Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, <span class="anchor">as </span>menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;  And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;  Knowing that of the Lord ye <span class="anchor">shall </span>receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.  But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no <span class="anchor">respect </span>of persons.</p><h2 id="chapter4">Chapter 4</h2><p> Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.  Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with <span class="anchor">thanksgiving; </span> Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:  That <span class="anchor">I </span>may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.  Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.  Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with <span class="anchor">salt, </span>that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.  All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant <span class="anchor">in </span>the Lord:  Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;  With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, <span class="anchor">who </span>is one of you. They shall make known unto you all things which are done here.  Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister&apos;s son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye <span class="anchor">received </span>commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)  And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which <span class="anchor">have </span>been a comfort unto me.  Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and <span class="anchor">complete </span>in all the will of God.  For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.  <span class="anchor">Luke, </span>the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.  Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house.  And when this epistle is <span class="anchor">read </span>among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea.  And say to Archippus, Take heed to <span class="anchor">the </span>ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.  The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.</p></body></html>
