Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of <span class="anchor">the </span>Father, in truth and love. I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father. And now I beseech thee, <span class="anchor">lady, </span>not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another. And this is love, that we walk after <span class="anchor">his </span>commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it. For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus <span class="anchor">Christ </span>is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full <span class="anchor">reward. </span>Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. If there <span class="anchor">come </span>any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed: For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil <span class="anchor">deeds. </span>Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may <span class="anchor">be </span>full. The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.</p><script> function bookAlert(x) { var m = "chapter" + x; var n = "z" + x; const y = document.getElementById(m); var k = y.innerHTML; const z = document.getElementsByTagName("h1"); y.innerHTML = "<div id=\"" + n + "\">" + z[0].innerHTML + "</div> " + k; const q = document.getElementById(n); q.style = "color:Red"; q.onclick = (function(){this.style.display="none"}); } </script></body></html>
