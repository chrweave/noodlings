Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, <span class="anchor">Dan, </span>and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already. And Joseph died, and all <span class="anchor">his </span>brethren, and all that generation. And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them. Now there arose <span class="anchor">up </span>a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph. And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we: Come on, <span class="anchor">let </span>us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and <span class="anchor">so </span>get them up out of the land. Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses. But <span class="anchor">the </span>more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel. And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with <span class="anchor">rigour: </span>And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, <span class="anchor">was </span>with rigour. And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: And he said, <span class="anchor">When </span>ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be <span class="anchor">a </span>daughter, then she shall live. But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive. And the king of Egypt <span class="anchor">called </span>for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?  And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women <span class="anchor">are </span>not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them. Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and <span class="anchor">waxed </span>very mighty. And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses. And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall <span class="anchor">cast </span>into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.</p><h2>Chapter 2</h2><p>And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi. And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him <span class="anchor">that </span>he was a goodly child, she hid him three months. And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime <span class="anchor">and </span>with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river&apos;s brink. And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to <span class="anchor">him. </span>And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river&apos;s side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, <span class="anchor">she </span>sent her maid to fetch it. And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is <span class="anchor">one </span>of the Hebrews&apos; children. Then said his sister to Pharaoh&apos;s daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for <span class="anchor">thee? </span> And Pharaoh&apos;s daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child&apos;s mother. And Pharaoh&apos;s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for <span class="anchor">me, </span>and I will give thee thy wages. And the women took the child, and nursed it. And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh&apos;s daughter, and he became her <span class="anchor">son. </span>And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water. And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he <span class="anchor">went </span>out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren. And he looked this way and that way, and when <span class="anchor">he </span>saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove <span class="anchor">together: </span>and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?  And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to <span class="anchor">kill </span>me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known. Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from <span class="anchor">the </span>face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well. Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, <span class="anchor">and </span>filled the troughs to water their father&apos;s flock. And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. And when they came <span class="anchor">to </span>Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day?  And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, <span class="anchor">and </span>also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock. And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, <span class="anchor">that </span>he may eat bread. And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter. And she bare him a son, and he called his name <span class="anchor">Gershom: </span>for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land. And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of <span class="anchor">Israel </span>sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage. And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant <span class="anchor">with </span>Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them.</p><h2>Chapter 3</h2><p>Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain <span class="anchor">of </span>God, even to Horeb. And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the <span class="anchor">bush </span>burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. And when the <span class="anchor">LORD </span>saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I. And he said, <span class="anchor">Draw </span>not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the <span class="anchor">God </span>of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God. And the LORD said, I have surely <span class="anchor">seen </span>the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; And I am come down to deliver <span class="anchor">them </span>out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; <span class="anchor">unto </span>the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites. Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is <span class="anchor">come </span>unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people <span class="anchor">the </span>children of Israel out of Egypt. And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out <span class="anchor">of </span>Egypt? And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out <span class="anchor">of </span>Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain. And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your <span class="anchor">fathers </span>hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?  And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I <span class="anchor">AM: </span>and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you. And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the <span class="anchor">children </span>of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for <span class="anchor">ever, </span>and this is my memorial unto all generations. Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of <span class="anchor">Isaac, </span>and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt: And I have said, I will bring you up <span class="anchor">out </span>of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with <span class="anchor">milk </span>and honey. And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The <span class="anchor">LORD </span>God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days&apos; journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God. <span class="anchor">And </span>I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand. And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all <span class="anchor">my </span>wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go. And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and <span class="anchor">it </span>shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty. But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of <span class="anchor">silver, </span>and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.</p><h2>Chapter 4</h2><p>And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared unto thee. And the LORD <span class="anchor">said </span>unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he said, A rod. And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became <span class="anchor">a </span>serpent; and Moses fled from before it. And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught <span class="anchor">it, </span>and it became a rod in his hand: That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of <span class="anchor">Jacob, </span>hath appeared unto thee. And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it <span class="anchor">out, </span>behold, his hand was leprous as snow. And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of <span class="anchor">his </span>bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh. And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first <span class="anchor">sign, </span>that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that <span class="anchor">thou </span>shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry <span class="anchor">land. </span>And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and of <span class="anchor">a </span>slow tongue. And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man&apos;s mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD? <span class="anchor"> </span>Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say. And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of <span class="anchor">him </span>whom thou wilt send. And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. <span class="anchor">And </span>also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart. And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his <span class="anchor">mouth: </span>and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do. And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall <span class="anchor">be, </span>even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God. And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt <span class="anchor">do </span>signs. And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt, <span class="anchor">and </span>see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace. And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are <span class="anchor">dead </span>which sought thy life. And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod <span class="anchor">of </span>God in his hand. And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in <span class="anchor">thine </span>hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go. And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is my son, even my <span class="anchor">firstborn: </span>And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn. <span class="anchor">And </span>it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him. Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin <span class="anchor">of </span>her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou to me. So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, <span class="anchor">because </span>of the circumcision. And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him. And <span class="anchor">Moses </span>told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him. And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the <span class="anchor">elders </span>of the children of Israel: And Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people. And the people <span class="anchor">believed: </span>and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.</p><h2>Chapter 5</h2><p>And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the <span class="anchor">wilderness. </span>And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go. And they said, <span class="anchor">The </span>God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days&apos; journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon <span class="anchor">us </span>with pestilence, or with the sword. And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens. <span class="anchor">And </span>Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens. And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and <span class="anchor">their </span>officers, saying, Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves. And the tale of the bricks, which they <span class="anchor">did </span>make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God. Let there <span class="anchor">more </span>work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words. And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they <span class="anchor">spake </span>to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw. Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be <span class="anchor">diminished. </span>So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw. And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as <span class="anchor">when </span>there was straw. And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh&apos;s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making <span class="anchor">brick </span>both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?  Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?  There <span class="anchor">is </span>no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people. But he said, Ye <span class="anchor">are </span>idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and do sacrifice to the LORD. Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall <span class="anchor">ye </span>deliver the tale of bricks. And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from <span class="anchor">your </span>bricks of your daily task. And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh: And they said unto them, The LORD look upon <span class="anchor">you, </span>and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to <span class="anchor">slay </span>us. And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me? For since I came to <span class="anchor">Pharaoh </span>to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.</p><h2>Chapter 6</h2><p>Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand <span class="anchor">shall </span>he drive them out of his land. And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD: And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by <span class="anchor">the </span>name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them. And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, <span class="anchor">the </span>land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers. And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my <span class="anchor">covenant. </span>Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of <span class="anchor">their </span>bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments: And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you <span class="anchor">a </span>God: and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. And I will bring you in unto the <span class="anchor">land, </span>concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I am the LORD. And Moses <span class="anchor">spake </span>so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Go in, speak unto <span class="anchor">Pharaoh </span>king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land. And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto <span class="anchor">me; </span>how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?  And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, <span class="anchor">and </span>unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt. These be the heads of their fathers&apos; houses: The sons of Reuben the firstborn <span class="anchor">of </span>Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these be the families of Reuben. And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son <span class="anchor">of </span>a Canaanitish woman: these are the families of Simeon. And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years <span class="anchor">of </span>the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years. The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families. And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and <span class="anchor">Hebron, </span>and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three years. And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the families of Levi <span class="anchor">according </span>to their generations. And Amram took him Jochebed his father&apos;s sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred <span class="anchor">and </span>thirty and seven years. And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri. And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri. And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of <span class="anchor">Amminadab, </span>sister of Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these are the families of the <span class="anchor">Korhites. </span>And Eleazar Aaron&apos;s son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to <span class="anchor">their </span>families. These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies. These are they which <span class="anchor">spake </span>to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron. And it came to pass on the day when the LORD <span class="anchor">spake </span>unto Moses in the land of Egypt, That the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I am the LORD: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee. <span class="anchor">And </span>Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me? </p><h2>Chapter 7</h2><p>And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet. Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: <span class="anchor">and </span>Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land. And I will harden Pharaoh&apos;s heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders <span class="anchor">in </span>the land of Egypt. But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of Israel, <span class="anchor">out </span>of the land of Egypt by great judgments. And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children <span class="anchor">of </span>Israel from among them. And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they. And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when <span class="anchor">they </span>spake unto Pharaoh. And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, <span class="anchor">Take </span>thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent. And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: and <span class="anchor">Aaron </span>cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent. Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they <span class="anchor">also </span>did in like manner with their enchantments. For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron&apos;s rod swallowed up their rods. And he hardened Pharaoh&apos;s heart, <span class="anchor">that </span>he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said. And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh&apos;s heart is hardened, he refuseth to let the people go. Get thee unto Pharaoh <span class="anchor">in </span>the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river&apos;s brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou <span class="anchor">take </span>in thine hand. And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in <span class="anchor">the </span>wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear. Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is <span class="anchor">in </span>mine hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood. And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall <span class="anchor">stink; </span>and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river. And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon <span class="anchor">the </span>waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood <span class="anchor">throughout </span>all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone. And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, <span class="anchor">and </span>smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned <span class="anchor">to </span>blood. And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout <span class="anchor">all </span>the land of Egypt. And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh&apos;s heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said. And <span class="anchor">Pharaoh </span>turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also. And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could <span class="anchor">not </span>drink of the water of the river. And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river.</p><h2>Chapter 8</h2><p>And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me. And if thou refuse to <span class="anchor">let </span>them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs: And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy <span class="anchor">bedchamber, </span>and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs: And the frogs shall come up both on <span class="anchor">thee, </span>and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants. And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, <span class="anchor">and </span>over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt. And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and <span class="anchor">covered </span>the land of Egypt. And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt. Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat <span class="anchor">the </span>LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD. And Moses <span class="anchor">said </span>unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may <span class="anchor">remain </span>in the river only?  And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD <span class="anchor">our </span>God. And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only. And Moses and Aaron <span class="anchor">went </span>out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh. And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the <span class="anchor">frogs </span>died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields. And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank. But when Pharaoh saw that there <span class="anchor">was </span>respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said. And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the <span class="anchor">dust </span>of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt. And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust <span class="anchor">of </span>the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt. And the magicians did so with <span class="anchor">their </span>enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast. Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and <span class="anchor">Pharaoh&apos;s </span>heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said. And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, <span class="anchor">he </span>cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me. Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, <span class="anchor">behold, </span>I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms <span class="anchor">of </span>flies, and also the ground whereon they are. And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be <span class="anchor">there; </span>to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth. And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow <span class="anchor">shall </span>this sign be. And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants&apos; houses, and into all the land <span class="anchor">of </span>Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies. And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land. <span class="anchor">And </span>Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the <span class="anchor">Egyptians </span>before their eyes, and will they not stone us?  We will go three days&apos; journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us. <span class="anchor">And </span>Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: intreat for me. And <span class="anchor">Moses </span>said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: <span class="anchor">but </span>let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD. And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD. And the LORD <span class="anchor">did </span>according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one. And Pharaoh hardened his heart <span class="anchor">at </span>this time also, neither would he let the people go.</p><h2>Chapter 9</h2><p>Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. For <span class="anchor">if </span>thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still, Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field, upon the horses, upon the <span class="anchor">asses, </span>upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain. And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of <span class="anchor">Egypt: </span>and there shall nothing die of all that is the children&apos;s of Israel. And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD shall do this thing in the <span class="anchor">land. </span>And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one. And Pharaoh sent, <span class="anchor">and, </span>behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go. And the LORD said <span class="anchor">unto </span>Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh. And it shall become small <span class="anchor">dust </span>in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt. And they took ashes of <span class="anchor">the </span>furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast. And the magicians could not <span class="anchor">stand </span>before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians. And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto <span class="anchor">them; </span>as the LORD had spoken unto Moses. And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD <span class="anchor">God </span>of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon <span class="anchor">thy </span>people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth. For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people <span class="anchor">with </span>pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth. And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew in thee my power; and that <span class="anchor">my </span>name may be declared throughout all the earth. As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?  Behold, to morrow about this time I <span class="anchor">will </span>cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now. Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all <span class="anchor">that </span>thou hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, <span class="anchor">and </span>they shall die. He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses: And he that regarded not <span class="anchor">the </span>word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field. And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in <span class="anchor">all </span>the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt. And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the <span class="anchor">LORD </span>sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt. So there was hail, and fire mingled with the <span class="anchor">hail, </span>very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all <span class="anchor">that </span>was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field. Only in the land of Goshen, where <span class="anchor">the </span>children of Israel were, was there no hail. And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and <span class="anchor">I </span>and my people are wicked. Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay <span class="anchor">no </span>longer. And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shall cease, neither <span class="anchor">shall </span>there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the LORD&apos;s. But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear <span class="anchor">the </span>LORD God. And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled. But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: <span class="anchor">for </span>they were not grown up. And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain <span class="anchor">was </span>not poured upon the earth. And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his <span class="anchor">servants. </span>And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.</p><h2>Chapter 10</h2><p>And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my signs before him: <span class="anchor">And </span>that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son&apos;s son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; <span class="anchor">that </span>ye may know how that I am the LORD. And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long <span class="anchor">wilt </span>thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me. Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring <span class="anchor">the </span>locusts into thy coast: And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which <span class="anchor">is </span>escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field: And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of <span class="anchor">all </span>thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers&apos; fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. <span class="anchor">And </span>he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh. And Pharaoh&apos;s servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may <span class="anchor">serve </span>the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?  And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD <span class="anchor">your </span>God: but who are they that shall go?  And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our <span class="anchor">flocks </span>and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto the LORD. And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will <span class="anchor">let </span>you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you. Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye did desire. <span class="anchor">And </span>they were driven out from Pharaoh&apos;s presence. And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon <span class="anchor">the </span>land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left. And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD <span class="anchor">brought </span>an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. And the locust went up over all <span class="anchor">the </span>land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such. For <span class="anchor">they </span>covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the <span class="anchor">hail </span>had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt. Then Pharaoh called for Moses and <span class="anchor">Aaron </span>in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you. Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and intreat the LORD <span class="anchor">your </span>God, that he may take away from me this death only. And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD. And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which <span class="anchor">took </span>away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt. But the LORD hardened Pharaoh&apos;s heart, so that he would <span class="anchor">not </span>let the children of Israel go. And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which <span class="anchor">may </span>be felt. And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days: They saw not one another, neither rose <span class="anchor">any </span>from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings. And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let <span class="anchor">your </span>flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you. And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto <span class="anchor">the </span>LORD our God. Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we <span class="anchor">know </span>not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither. But the LORD hardened Pharaoh&apos;s heart, and he would not let them go. And Pharaoh said unto him, Get <span class="anchor">thee </span>from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die. And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will <span class="anchor">see </span>thy face again no more.</p><h2>Chapter 11</h2><p>And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, <span class="anchor">he </span>shall surely thrust you out hence altogether. Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of <span class="anchor">silver </span>and jewels of gold. And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the <span class="anchor">sight </span>of Pharaoh&apos;s servants, and in the sight of the people. And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt: And all the <span class="anchor">firstborn </span>in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and <span class="anchor">all </span>the firstborn of beasts. And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more. <span class="anchor">But </span>against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD doth put a difference between <span class="anchor">the </span>Egyptians and Israel. And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and <span class="anchor">after </span>that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger. And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my wonders may <span class="anchor">be </span>multiplied in the land of Egypt. And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the LORD hardened Pharaoh&apos;s heart, so that he would not let the children of <span class="anchor">Israel </span>go out of his land.</p><h2>Chapter 12</h2><p>And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying, This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of <span class="anchor">the </span>year to you. Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the <span class="anchor">house </span>of their fathers, a lamb for an house: And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to <span class="anchor">the </span>number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb. Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall <span class="anchor">take </span>it out from the sheep, or from the goats: And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of <span class="anchor">Israel </span>shall kill it in the evening. And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein <span class="anchor">they </span>shall eat it. And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it. Eat not of it raw, <span class="anchor">nor </span>sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof. And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and <span class="anchor">that </span>which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire. And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in <span class="anchor">your </span>hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the LORD&apos;s passover. For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in <span class="anchor">the </span>land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD. And the blood shall be to you for a <span class="anchor">token </span>upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite <span class="anchor">the </span>land of Egypt. And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a <span class="anchor">feast </span>by an ordinance for ever. Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from <span class="anchor">the </span>first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel. And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there <span class="anchor">shall </span>be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you. And ye <span class="anchor">shall </span>observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations <span class="anchor">by </span>an ordinance for ever. In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month <span class="anchor">at </span>even. Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, <span class="anchor">whether </span>he be a stranger, or born in the land. Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread. Then Moses called for all the elders of <span class="anchor">Israel, </span>and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover. And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in <span class="anchor">the </span>blood that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at <span class="anchor">the </span>door of his house until the morning. For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side <span class="anchor">posts, </span>the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you. And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance <span class="anchor">to </span>thee and to thy sons for ever. And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, <span class="anchor">that </span>ye shall keep this service. And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service?  That ye shall say, It is <span class="anchor">the </span>sacrifice of the LORD&apos;s passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the <span class="anchor">head </span>and worshipped. And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. And it came to pass, that at midnight the <span class="anchor">LORD </span>smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and <span class="anchor">all </span>the firstborn of cattle. And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was <span class="anchor">not </span>a house where there was not one dead. And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye <span class="anchor">and </span>the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said. Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also. <span class="anchor">And </span>the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men. And the people took their <span class="anchor">dough </span>before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders. And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of <span class="anchor">the </span>Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things <span class="anchor">as </span>they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians. And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children. And a mixed <span class="anchor">multitude </span>went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle. And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was <span class="anchor">not </span>leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual. Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in <span class="anchor">Egypt, </span>was four hundred and thirty years. And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all <span class="anchor">the </span>hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt. It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: <span class="anchor">this </span>is that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations. And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of <span class="anchor">the </span>passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof: But every man&apos;s servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof. A foreigner and an hired <span class="anchor">servant </span>shall not eat thereof. In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone <span class="anchor">thereof. </span>All the congregation of Israel shall keep it. And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and <span class="anchor">then </span>let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof. One law shall be to <span class="anchor">him </span>that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you. Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. And it came <span class="anchor">to </span>pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.</p><h2>Chapter 13</h2><p>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine. <span class="anchor">And </span>Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out <span class="anchor">from </span>this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten. This day came ye out in the month Abib. And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land <span class="anchor">of </span>the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that <span class="anchor">thou </span>shalt keep this service in this month. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the LORD. Unleavened bread shall be eaten <span class="anchor">seven </span>days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters. And thou shalt shew thy son in that <span class="anchor">day, </span>saying, This is done because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt. And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine <span class="anchor">hand, </span>and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD&apos;s law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt. Thou shalt <span class="anchor">therefore </span>keep this ordinance in his season from year to year. And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee <span class="anchor">and </span>to thy fathers, and shall give it thee, That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou <span class="anchor">hast; </span>the males shall be the LORD&apos;s. And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: <span class="anchor">and </span>all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem. And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt <span class="anchor">say </span>unto him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage: And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that <span class="anchor">the </span>LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, <span class="anchor">being </span>males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem. And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand <span class="anchor">the </span>LORD brought us forth out of Egypt. And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of <span class="anchor">the </span>Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt: But God led the people about, through the way <span class="anchor">of </span>the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt. And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he <span class="anchor">had </span>straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you. And they took their journey from Succoth, and <span class="anchor">encamped </span>in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness. And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in <span class="anchor">a </span>pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night: He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, <span class="anchor">from </span>before the people.</p><h2>Chapter 14</h2><p>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall <span class="anchor">ye </span>encamp by the sea. For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in. And I will harden Pharaoh&apos;s heart, <span class="anchor">that </span>he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so. <span class="anchor">And </span>it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we <span class="anchor">done </span>this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?  And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him: And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and <span class="anchor">all </span>the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them. And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and <span class="anchor">the </span>children of Israel went out with an high hand. But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them <span class="anchor">encamping </span>by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon. And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore <span class="anchor">afraid: </span>and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD. And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the <span class="anchor">wilderness? </span>wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?  Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, <span class="anchor">that </span>we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness. And Moses said unto the people, Fear <span class="anchor">ye </span>not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them <span class="anchor">again </span>no more for ever. The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace. And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children <span class="anchor">of </span>Israel, that they go forward: But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry <span class="anchor">ground </span>through the midst of the sea. And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and <span class="anchor">upon </span>all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, <span class="anchor">and </span>upon his horsemen. And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, <span class="anchor">and </span>stood behind them: And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by <span class="anchor">night </span>to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night. And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go <span class="anchor">back </span>by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea <span class="anchor">upon </span>the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left. And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst <span class="anchor">of </span>the sea, even all Pharaoh&apos;s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through <span class="anchor">the </span>pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians, And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let <span class="anchor">us </span>flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians. And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters <span class="anchor">may </span>come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen. And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning <span class="anchor">appeared; </span>and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all <span class="anchor">the </span>host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them. But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst <span class="anchor">of </span>the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left. Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the <span class="anchor">Egyptians; </span>and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore. And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed <span class="anchor">the </span>LORD, and his servant Moses.</p><h2>Chapter 15</h2><p>Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his <span class="anchor">rider </span>hath he thrown into the sea. The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my <span class="anchor">father&apos;s </span>God, and I will exalt him. The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name. Pharaoh&apos;s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen <span class="anchor">captains </span>also are drowned in the Red sea. The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone. Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy <span class="anchor">right </span>hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy. And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which <span class="anchor">consumed </span>them as stubble. And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of <span class="anchor">the </span>sea. The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy <span class="anchor">them. </span>Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters. Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like <span class="anchor">thee, </span>glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?  Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them. Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast <span class="anchor">redeemed: </span>thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation. The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina. Then the dukes of <span class="anchor">Edom </span>shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away. Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the <span class="anchor">greatness </span>of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased. Thou shalt bring them <span class="anchor">in, </span>and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which thy hands <span class="anchor">have </span>established. The LORD shall reign for ever and ever. For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again <span class="anchor">the </span>waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea. And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a <span class="anchor">timbrel </span>in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances. And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the <span class="anchor">horse </span>and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days <span class="anchor">in </span>the wilderness, and found no water. And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was <span class="anchor">called </span>Marah. And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?  And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree, which when he had cast <span class="anchor">into </span>the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them, And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the <span class="anchor">voice </span>of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none <span class="anchor">of </span>these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee. And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and <span class="anchor">threescore </span>and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.</p><h2>Chapter 16</h2><p>And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth <span class="anchor">day </span>of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt. And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness: And <span class="anchor">the </span>children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and <span class="anchor">when </span>we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger. Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I <span class="anchor">will </span>rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, <span class="anchor">or </span>no. And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily. <span class="anchor">And </span>Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt: And in the <span class="anchor">morning, </span>then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what are we, that ye murmur against us?  And Moses said, <span class="anchor">This </span>shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye <span class="anchor">murmur </span>against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD. And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, <span class="anchor">Come </span>near before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings. And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward <span class="anchor">the </span>wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto <span class="anchor">them, </span>saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God. And it came <span class="anchor">to </span>pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host. And when the dew that lay was gone <span class="anchor">up, </span>behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground. And when the children of Israel saw it, they <span class="anchor">said </span>one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat. This <span class="anchor">is </span>the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every <span class="anchor">man </span>for them which are in his tents. And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less. And when they did mete it with an omer, he that <span class="anchor">gathered </span>much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating. And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the <span class="anchor">morning. </span>Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them. And they gathered <span class="anchor">it </span>every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted. And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much <span class="anchor">bread, </span>two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To morrow <span class="anchor">is </span>the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for <span class="anchor">you </span>to be kept until the morning. And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein. And Moses said, <span class="anchor">Eat </span>that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field. Six days ye shall gather it; but on the <span class="anchor">seventh </span>day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none. And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, <span class="anchor">and </span>they found none. And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?  See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, <span class="anchor">therefore </span>he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. <span class="anchor">So </span>the people rested on the seventh day. And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like <span class="anchor">wafers </span>made with honey. And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread <span class="anchor">wherewith </span>I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt. And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of <span class="anchor">manna </span>therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations. As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept. And <span class="anchor">the </span>children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan. Now <span class="anchor">an </span>omer is the tenth part of an ephah.</p><h2>Chapter 17</h2><p>And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there <span class="anchor">was </span>no water for the people to drink. Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye <span class="anchor">with </span>me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?  And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us <span class="anchor">up </span>out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?  And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be <span class="anchor">almost </span>ready to stone me. And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the <span class="anchor">river, </span>take in thine hand, and go. Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of <span class="anchor">it, </span>that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the <span class="anchor">chiding </span>of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?  Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim. And Moses <span class="anchor">said </span>unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand. <span class="anchor">So </span>Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. And it came to pass, when <span class="anchor">Moses </span>held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, <span class="anchor">and </span>he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the <span class="anchor">going </span>down of the sun. And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, <span class="anchor">and </span>rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven. And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it <span class="anchor">Jehovahnissi: </span>For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.</p><h2>Chapter 18</h2><p>When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses&apos; father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the LORD had brought Israel <span class="anchor">out </span>of Egypt; Then Jethro, Moses&apos; father in law, took Zipporah, Moses&apos; wife, after he had sent her back, And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; <span class="anchor">for </span>he said, I have been an alien in a strange land: And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was mine help, and <span class="anchor">delivered </span>me from the sword of Pharaoh: And Jethro, Moses&apos; father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of <span class="anchor">God: </span>And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her. And Moses went out to meet his <span class="anchor">father </span>in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent. And Moses told his father in law all that <span class="anchor">the </span>LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel&apos;s sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them. And <span class="anchor">Jethro </span>rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians. And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who <span class="anchor">hath </span>delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. Now I know <span class="anchor">that </span>the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them. And Jethro, Moses&apos; father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices <span class="anchor">for </span>God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses&apos; father in law before God. And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat <span class="anchor">to </span>judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening. And when Moses&apos; father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, <span class="anchor">What </span>is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?  And Moses said unto his <span class="anchor">father </span>in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God: When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do <span class="anchor">make </span>them know the statutes of God, and his laws. And Moses&apos; father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good. Thou wilt surely wear away, both <span class="anchor">thou, </span>and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone. Hearken now unto my voice, I will <span class="anchor">give </span>thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God: And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, <span class="anchor">and </span>shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do. Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, <span class="anchor">men </span>of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens: And let them judge the people <span class="anchor">at </span>all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they <span class="anchor">shall </span>bear the burden with thee. If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to <span class="anchor">their </span>place in peace. So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said. And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and <span class="anchor">made </span>them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought <span class="anchor">unto </span>Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves. And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.</p><h2>Chapter 19</h2><p>In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai. For they were <span class="anchor">departed </span>from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount. And Moses went up unto God, and the <span class="anchor">LORD </span>called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel; Ye have seen what I did unto the <span class="anchor">Egyptians, </span>and how I bare you on eagles&apos; wings, and brought you unto myself. Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a <span class="anchor">peculiar </span>treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine: And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which <span class="anchor">thou </span>shalt speak unto the children of Israel. And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him. <span class="anchor">And </span>all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD. And the LORD said <span class="anchor">unto </span>Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of <span class="anchor">the </span>people unto the LORD. And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes, And be ready <span class="anchor">against </span>the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai. And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round <span class="anchor">about, </span>saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death: There shall <span class="anchor">not </span>an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come <span class="anchor">up </span>to the mount. And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes. And he said unto the people, Be ready against <span class="anchor">the </span>third day: come not at your wives. And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the <span class="anchor">mount, </span>and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled. And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet <span class="anchor">with </span>God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount. And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof <span class="anchor">ascended </span>as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered <span class="anchor">him </span>by a voice. And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses <span class="anchor">went </span>up. And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish. And let the priests also, <span class="anchor">which </span>come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them. And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst <span class="anchor">us, </span>saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it. And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let <span class="anchor">not </span>the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them. So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.</p><h2>Chapter 20</h2><p>And God spake all these words, saying, I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt <span class="anchor">have </span>no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth <span class="anchor">beneath, </span>or that is in the water under the earth. Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting <span class="anchor">the </span>iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my <span class="anchor">commandments. </span>Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. Remember the sabbath day, <span class="anchor">to </span>keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do <span class="anchor">any </span>work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: For in six days the LORD made <span class="anchor">heaven </span>and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. Honour thy father and thy mother: <span class="anchor">that </span>thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not <span class="anchor">bear </span>false witness against thy neighbour. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour&apos;s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour&apos;s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, <span class="anchor">nor </span>any thing that is thy neighbour&apos;s. And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw <span class="anchor">it, </span>they removed, and stood afar off. And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die. And Moses <span class="anchor">said </span>unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not. And the people stood afar off, <span class="anchor">and </span>Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was. And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have <span class="anchor">talked </span>with you from heaven. Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold. An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, <span class="anchor">and </span>shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will <span class="anchor">bless </span>thee. And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted <span class="anchor">it. </span>Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.</p><h2>Chapter 21</h2><p>Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them. If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free <span class="anchor">for </span>nothing. If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him. If his master have given him <span class="anchor">a </span>wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master&apos;s, and he shall go out by himself. And if the servant shall plainly <span class="anchor">say, </span>I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free: Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the <span class="anchor">door, </span>or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever. And if a man sell his daughter to <span class="anchor">be </span>a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do. If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to <span class="anchor">sell </span>her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her. And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her <span class="anchor">after </span>the manner of daughters. If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish. And if he do not these three unto <span class="anchor">her, </span>then shall she go out free without money. He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death. And if a man lie not in wait, <span class="anchor">but </span>God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee. But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; <span class="anchor">thou </span>shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die. And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death. And he that stealeth a man, <span class="anchor">and </span>selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death. And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to <span class="anchor">death. </span>And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed: If he rise again, and walk abroad <span class="anchor">upon </span>his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed. And if a <span class="anchor">man </span>smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished. Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not <span class="anchor">be </span>punished: for he is his money. If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely <span class="anchor">punished, </span>according as the woman&apos;s husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life, Eye for <span class="anchor">eye, </span>tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe. And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye <span class="anchor">of </span>his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye&apos;s sake. And if he smite out his manservant&apos;s tooth, or his maidservant&apos;s tooth; he shall let him <span class="anchor">go </span>free for his tooth&apos;s sake. If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; <span class="anchor">but </span>the owner of the ox shall be quit. But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and <span class="anchor">he </span>hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death. If there <span class="anchor">be </span>laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him. Whether he have gored a son, or have gored <span class="anchor">a </span>daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him. If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, <span class="anchor">and </span>the ox shall be stoned. And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass <span class="anchor">fall </span>therein; The owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his. And if one man&apos;s ox hurt <span class="anchor">another&apos;s, </span>that he die; then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also they shall divide. Or if it be known that the <span class="anchor">ox </span>hath used to push in time past, and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the dead shall be his own.</p><h2>Chapter 22</h2><p>If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep. If <span class="anchor">a </span>thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, there shall no blood be shed for him. If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed <span class="anchor">for </span>him; for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft. If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it <span class="anchor">be </span>ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double. If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast, and shall feed in <span class="anchor">another </span>man&apos;s field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution. If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that <span class="anchor">the </span>stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed therewith; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution. If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money <span class="anchor">or </span>stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man&apos;s house; if the thief be found, let him pay double. If the thief be not found, then the master of <span class="anchor">the </span>house shall be brought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour&apos;s goods. For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, <span class="anchor">for </span>sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing which another challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; and whom the judges shall <span class="anchor">condemn, </span>he shall pay double unto his neighbour. If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or <span class="anchor">be </span>hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it: Then shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour&apos;s goods; and <span class="anchor">the </span>owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it good. And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof. If it be <span class="anchor">torn </span>in pieces, then let him bring it for witness, and he shall not make good that which was torn. And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be <span class="anchor">hurt, </span>or die, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make it good. But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if it <span class="anchor">be </span>an hired thing, it came for his hire. And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his <span class="anchor">wife. </span>If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins. Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live. Whosoever lieth with <span class="anchor">a </span>beast shall surely be put to death. He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed. Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress <span class="anchor">him: </span>for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child. If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto <span class="anchor">me, </span>I will surely hear their cry; And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless. If <span class="anchor">thou </span>lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury. If thou at <span class="anchor">all </span>take thy neighbour&apos;s raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down: For that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin: <span class="anchor">wherein </span>shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious. Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the <span class="anchor">ruler </span>of thy people. Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me. Likewise shalt <span class="anchor">thou </span>do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me. And ye shall be holy men <span class="anchor">unto </span>me: neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.</p><h2>Chapter 23</h2><p>Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness. Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou <span class="anchor">speak </span>in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment: Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause. If thou meet thine enemy&apos;s ox or his ass going astray, <span class="anchor">thou </span>shalt surely bring it back to him again. If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely <span class="anchor">help </span>with him. Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause. Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I <span class="anchor">will </span>not justify the wicked. And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous. Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for <span class="anchor">ye </span>know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof: But <span class="anchor">the </span>seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like <span class="anchor">manner </span>thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard. Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass <span class="anchor">may </span>rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed. And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the <span class="anchor">name </span>of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth. Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year. Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened <span class="anchor">bread: </span>(thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear <span class="anchor">before </span>me empty:) And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the <span class="anchor">year, </span>when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field. Three items in the year all thy males shall appear before the LORD God. Thou shalt not offer the blood <span class="anchor">of </span>my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning. The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of <span class="anchor">the </span>LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother&apos;s milk. Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into <span class="anchor">the </span>place which I have prepared. Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him. But if thou <span class="anchor">shalt </span>indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries. For mine Angel shall go before <span class="anchor">thee, </span>and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off. Thou shalt not bow <span class="anchor">down </span>to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images. And ye shall serve the LORD your God, <span class="anchor">and </span>he shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee. There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: <span class="anchor">the </span>number of thy days I will fulfil. I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine <span class="anchor">enemies </span>turn their backs unto thee. And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee. I will not drive them <span class="anchor">out </span>from before thee in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee. By little and little I will drive them out from before <span class="anchor">thee, </span>until thou be increased, and inherit the land. And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the <span class="anchor">river: </span>for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee. Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods. <span class="anchor">They </span>shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.</p><h2>Chapter 24</h2><p>And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the LORD, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar off. And Moses alone <span class="anchor">shall </span>come near the LORD: but they shall not come nigh; neither shall the people go up with him. And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, <span class="anchor">and </span>all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the LORD hath said will we do. And Moses wrote all the words of <span class="anchor">the </span>LORD, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel. And he sent young men of <span class="anchor">the </span>children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the LORD. And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basons; and half of <span class="anchor">the </span>blood he sprinkled on the altar. And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that the LORD hath said <span class="anchor">will </span>we do, and be obedient. And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you <span class="anchor">concerning </span>all these words. Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel: And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his <span class="anchor">feet </span>as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness. And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he <span class="anchor">laid </span>not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink. And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will <span class="anchor">give </span>thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them. And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into <span class="anchor">the </span>mount of God. And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man <span class="anchor">have </span>any matters to do, let him come unto them. And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount. And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount <span class="anchor">Sinai, </span>and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud. And the sight of the glory of the LORD <span class="anchor">was </span>like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel. And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into <span class="anchor">the </span>mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.</p><h2>Chapter 25</h2><p>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering: of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall <span class="anchor">take </span>my offering. And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and silver, and brass, And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats&apos; hair, And <span class="anchor">rams&apos; </span>skins dyed red, and badgers&apos; skins, and shittim wood, Oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet incense, Onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, <span class="anchor">and </span>in the breastplate. And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them. According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the <span class="anchor">pattern </span>of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it. And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and <span class="anchor">a </span>cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, <span class="anchor">and </span>shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about. And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four corners thereof; and two rings <span class="anchor">shall </span>be in the one side of it, and two rings in the other side of it. And thou shalt make staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold. And thou <span class="anchor">shalt </span>put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, that the ark may be borne with them. The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they <span class="anchor">shall </span>not be taken from it. And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee. And thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits <span class="anchor">and </span>a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof. And thou shalt make two cherubims of gold, of beaten work shalt thou make them, <span class="anchor">in </span>the two ends of the mercy seat. And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end: even of the mercy seat shall ye make <span class="anchor">the </span>cherubims on the two ends thereof. And the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; <span class="anchor">toward </span>the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be. And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that <span class="anchor">I </span>shall give thee. And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark <span class="anchor">of </span>the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel. Thou shalt also make a table of shittim wood: two cubits shall be the <span class="anchor">length </span>thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold <span class="anchor">round </span>about. And thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about. And thou shalt <span class="anchor">make </span>for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof. Over against the border shall the rings be for places <span class="anchor">of </span>the staves to bear the table. And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be borne with them. And thou shalt <span class="anchor">make </span>the dishes thereof, and spoons thereof, and covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover withal: of pure gold shalt thou make them. And thou shalt set upon the table shewbread before <span class="anchor">me </span>alway. And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall <span class="anchor">be </span>of the same. And six branches shall come out of the sides of it; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and three branches of the candlestick out <span class="anchor">of </span>the other side: Three bowls made like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower in one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch, with a knop <span class="anchor">and </span>a flower: so in the six branches that come out of the candlestick. And in the candlesticks shall be four bowls made like unto almonds, with their knops and their flowers. <span class="anchor">And </span>there shall be a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to <span class="anchor">the </span>six branches that proceed out of the candlestick. Their knops and their branches shall be of the same: all it shall be one beaten work of pure gold. And thou shalt <span class="anchor">make </span>the seven lamps thereof: and they shall light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against it. And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be of pure <span class="anchor">gold. </span>Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these vessels. And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was shewed thee in the mount.</p><h2>Chapter 26</h2><p>Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work shalt thou make them. The length of <span class="anchor">one </span>curtain shall be eight and twenty cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: and every one of the curtains shall have one measure. The five curtains shall be coupled <span class="anchor">together </span>one to another; and other five curtains shall be coupled one to another. And thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain from the selvedge in <span class="anchor">the </span>coupling; and likewise shalt thou make in the uttermost edge of another curtain, in the coupling of the second. Fifty loops shalt thou make in the one curtain, and fifty loops <span class="anchor">shalt </span>thou make in the edge of the curtain that is in the coupling of the second; that the loops may take hold one of another. And thou shalt make fifty taches <span class="anchor">of </span>gold, and couple the curtains together with the taches: and it shall be one tabernacle. And thou shalt make curtains of goats&apos; hair to be a covering upon the tabernacle: eleven <span class="anchor">curtains </span>shalt thou make. The length of one curtain shall be thirty cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: and the eleven curtains shall be all of one measure. And <span class="anchor">thou </span>shalt couple five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves, and shalt double the sixth curtain in the forefront of the tabernacle. And thou shalt make fifty loops on the <span class="anchor">edge </span>of the one curtain that is outmost in the coupling, and fifty loops in the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second. And thou shalt make fifty taches of brass, <span class="anchor">and </span>put the taches into the loops, and couple the tent together, that it may be one. And the remnant that remaineth of the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that <span class="anchor">remaineth, </span>shall hang over the backside of the tabernacle. And a cubit on the one side, and a cubit on the other side of that which remaineth in the length of the <span class="anchor">curtains </span>of the tent, it shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this side and on that side, to cover it. And thou shalt make a covering for the tent <span class="anchor">of </span>rams&apos; skins dyed red, and a covering above of badgers&apos; skins. And thou shalt make boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood standing up. Ten cubits shall be the length of <span class="anchor">a </span>board, and a cubit and a half shall be the breadth of one board. Two tenons shall there be in one board, set in order one against another: thus shalt thou <span class="anchor">make </span>for all the boards of the tabernacle. And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards on the south side southward. And thou shalt make forty sockets of silver <span class="anchor">under </span>the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons. And for the second side of the tabernacle on <span class="anchor">the </span>north side there shall be twenty boards: And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board. And for the sides of the tabernacle <span class="anchor">westward </span>thou shalt make six boards. And two boards shalt thou make for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides. And they shall be coupled together beneath, and they shall <span class="anchor">be </span>coupled together above the head of it unto one ring: thus shall it be for them both; they shall be for the two corners. And they shall be eight boards, and <span class="anchor">their </span>sockets of silver, sixteen sockets; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board. And thou shalt make bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one <span class="anchor">side </span>of the tabernacle, And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the side of the tabernacle, for the two <span class="anchor">sides </span>westward. And the middle bar in the midst of the boards shall reach from end to end. And thou shalt overlay the boards with gold, and make their rings of gold <span class="anchor">for </span>places for the bars: and thou shalt overlay the bars with gold. And thou shalt rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion thereof which was shewed thee in the mount. <span class="anchor">And </span>thou shalt make a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen of cunning work: with cherubims shall it be made: And thou shalt hang it upon four <span class="anchor">pillars </span>of shittim wood overlaid with gold: their hooks shall be of gold, upon the four sockets of silver. And thou shalt hang up the vail under the taches, that thou mayest <span class="anchor">bring </span>in thither within the vail the ark of the testimony: and the vail shall divide unto you between the holy place and the most holy. And thou shalt put the mercy <span class="anchor">seat </span>upon the ark of the testimony in the most holy place. And thou shalt set the table without the vail, and the candlestick over against the table on the side of <span class="anchor">the </span>tabernacle toward the south: and thou shalt put the table on the north side. And thou shalt make an hanging for the door of the tent, of blue, and purple, and <span class="anchor">scarlet, </span>and fine twined linen, wrought with needlework. And thou shalt make for the hanging five pillars of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold, and their hooks shall be of gold: <span class="anchor">and </span>thou shalt cast five sockets of brass for them.</p><h2>Chapter 27</h2><p>And thou shalt make an altar of shittim wood, five cubits long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare: and the height thereof shall be three cubits. And thou <span class="anchor">shalt </span>make the horns of it upon the four corners thereof: his horns shall be of the same: and thou shalt overlay it with brass. And thou shalt make his pans to <span class="anchor">receive </span>his ashes, and his shovels, and his basons, and his fleshhooks, and his firepans: all the vessels thereof thou shalt make of brass. And thou shalt make for it a grate <span class="anchor">of </span>network of brass; and upon the net shalt thou make four brasen rings in the four corners thereof. And thou shalt put it under the compass of the altar beneath, that <span class="anchor">the </span>net may be even to the midst of the altar. And thou shalt make staves for the altar, staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with brass. And the staves shall <span class="anchor">be </span>put into the rings, and the staves shall be upon the two sides of the altar, to bear it. Hollow with boards shalt thou make it: as it was shewed thee <span class="anchor">in </span>the mount, so shall they make it. And thou shalt make the court of the tabernacle: for the south side southward there shall be hangings for the court of fine twined <span class="anchor">linen </span>of an hundred cubits long for one side: And the twenty pillars thereof and their twenty sockets shall be of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets shall be <span class="anchor">of </span>silver. And likewise for the north side in length there shall be hangings of an hundred cubits long, and his twenty pillars and their twenty sockets of brass; the hooks of <span class="anchor">the </span>pillars and their fillets of silver. And for the breadth of the court on the west side shall be hangings of fifty cubits: their pillars ten, and their sockets ten. And <span class="anchor">the </span>breadth of the court on the east side eastward shall be fifty cubits. The hangings of one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits: their pillars three, and their sockets <span class="anchor">three. </span>And on the other side shall be hangings fifteen cubits: their pillars three, and their sockets three. And for the gate of the court shall be an hanging of twenty cubits, <span class="anchor">of </span>blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought with needlework: and their pillars shall be four, and their sockets four. All the pillars round about the court shall be <span class="anchor">filleted </span>with silver; their hooks shall be of silver, and their sockets of brass. The length of the court shall be an hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty every where, and the <span class="anchor">height </span>five cubits of fine twined linen, and their sockets of brass. All the vessels of the tabernacle in all the service thereof, and all the pins thereof, and all the pins <span class="anchor">of </span>the court, shall be of brass. And thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they bring thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamp to burn <span class="anchor">always. </span>In the tabernacle of the congregation without the vail, which is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall order it from evening to morning before the LORD: it shall be <span class="anchor">a </span>statute for ever unto their generations on the behalf of the children of Israel.</p><h2>Chapter 28</h2><p>And take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him, from among the children of Israel, that he may minister unto me in the priest&apos;s office, even Aaron, <span class="anchor">Nadab </span>and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron&apos;s sons. And thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother for glory and for beauty. And thou shalt speak unto all that are wise <span class="anchor">hearted, </span>whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make Aaron&apos;s garments to consecrate him, that he may minister unto me in the priest&apos;s office. And these are <span class="anchor">the </span>garments which they shall make; a breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a broidered coat, a mitre, and a girdle: and they shall make holy garments for Aaron thy <span class="anchor">brother, </span>and his sons, that he may minister unto me in the priest&apos;s office. And they shall take gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen. And they shall make <span class="anchor">the </span>ephod of gold, of blue, and of purple, of scarlet, and fine twined linen, with cunning work. It shall have the two shoulderpieces thereof joined at the two edges thereof; and <span class="anchor">so </span>it shall be joined together. And the curious girdle of the ephod, which is upon it, shall be of the same, according to the work thereof; even of gold, of blue, <span class="anchor">and </span>purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. And thou shalt take two onyx stones, and grave on them the names of the children of Israel: Six of their names on one <span class="anchor">stone, </span>and the other six names of the rest on the other stone, according to their birth. With the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings of a signet, shalt <span class="anchor">thou </span>engrave the two stones with the names of the children of Israel: thou shalt make them to be set in ouches of gold. And thou shalt put the two stones upon <span class="anchor">the </span>shoulders of the ephod for stones of memorial unto the children of Israel: and Aaron shall bear their names before the LORD upon his two shoulders for a memorial. And thou <span class="anchor">shalt </span>make ouches of gold; And two chains of pure gold at the ends; of wreathen work shalt thou make them, and fasten the wreathen chains to the ouches. And thou shalt <span class="anchor">make </span>the breastplate of judgment with cunning work; after the work of the ephod thou shalt make it; of gold, of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine twined <span class="anchor">linen, </span>shalt thou make it. Foursquare it shall be being doubled; a span shall be the length thereof, and a span shall be the breadth thereof. And thou shalt set in it <span class="anchor">settings </span>of stones, even four rows of stones: the first row shall be a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this shall be the first row. And the second row shall be <span class="anchor">an </span>emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond. And the third row a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst. And the fourth row a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper: they shall <span class="anchor">be </span>set in gold in their inclosings. And the stones shall be with the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet; every <span class="anchor">one </span>with his name shall they be according to the twelve tribes. And thou shalt make upon the breastplate chains at the ends of wreathen work of pure gold. And thou shalt <span class="anchor">make </span>upon the breastplate two rings of gold, and shalt put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate. And thou shalt put the two wreathen chains of gold in <span class="anchor">the </span>two rings which are on the ends of the breastplate. And the other two ends of the two wreathen chains thou shalt fasten in the two ouches, and put them on <span class="anchor">the </span>shoulderpieces of the ephod before it. And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and thou shalt put them upon the two ends of the breastplate in the border thereof, which <span class="anchor">is </span>in the side of the ephod inward. And two other rings of gold thou shalt make, and shalt put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart <span class="anchor">thereof, </span>over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod. And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a <span class="anchor">lace </span>of blue, that it may be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate be not loosed from the ephod. And Aaron shall bear the names of the <span class="anchor">children </span>of Israel in the breastplate of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth in unto the holy place, for a memorial before the LORD continually. And thou shalt put in the <span class="anchor">breastplate </span>of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be upon Aaron&apos;s heart, when he goeth in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of <span class="anchor">Israel </span>upon his heart before the LORD continually. And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all of blue. And there shall be an hole in the top of it, in <span class="anchor">the </span>midst thereof: it shall have a binding of woven work round about the hole of it, as it were the hole of an habergeon, that it be not rent. And beneath <span class="anchor">upon </span>the hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, round about the hem thereof; and bells of gold between them round about: A golden <span class="anchor">bell </span>and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, upon the hem of the robe round about. And it shall be upon Aaron to minister: and his sound shall be heard <span class="anchor">when </span>he goeth in unto the holy place before the LORD, and when he cometh out, that he die not. And thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and grave upon <span class="anchor">it, </span>like the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD. And thou shalt put it on a blue lace, that it may be upon the mitre; upon the forefront of the <span class="anchor">mitre </span>it shall be. And it shall be upon Aaron&apos;s forehead, that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel shall hallow in all their holy <span class="anchor">gifts; </span>and it shall be always upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before the LORD. And thou shalt embroider the coat of fine linen, and thou shalt make the mitre <span class="anchor">of </span>fine linen, and thou shalt make the girdle of needlework. And for Aaron&apos;s sons thou shalt make coats, and thou shalt make for them girdles, and bonnets shalt thou make for <span class="anchor">them, </span>for glory and for beauty. And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him; and shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they <span class="anchor">may </span>minister unto me in the priest&apos;s office. And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover their nakedness; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall reach: And they shall <span class="anchor">be </span>upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they come in unto the tabernacle of the congregation, or when they come near unto the altar to minister in the holy place; that <span class="anchor">they </span>bear not iniquity, and die: it shall be a statute for ever unto him and his seed after him.</p><h2>Chapter 29</h2><p>And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them, to minister unto me in the priest&apos;s office: Take one young bullock, and two rams without blemish, <span class="anchor">And </span>unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: of wheaten flour shalt thou make them. And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring <span class="anchor">them </span>in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams. And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shalt wash them <span class="anchor">with </span>water. And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the coat, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the curious <span class="anchor">girdle </span>of the ephod: And thou shalt put the mitre upon his head, and put the holy crown upon the mitre. Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon <span class="anchor">his </span>head, and anoint him. And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them. And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and put the bonnets on <span class="anchor">them: </span>and the priest&apos;s office shall be theirs for a perpetual statute: and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons. And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle <span class="anchor">of </span>the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the bullock. And thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD, by the door of the <span class="anchor">tabernacle </span>of the congregation. And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all the blood beside <span class="anchor">the </span>bottom of the altar. And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul that is above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that <span class="anchor">is </span>upon them, and burn them upon the altar. But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung, shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it is a <span class="anchor">sin </span>offering. Thou shalt also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram. And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt <span class="anchor">take </span>his blood, and sprinkle it round about upon the altar. And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of him, and his legs, and put them unto <span class="anchor">his </span>pieces, and unto his head. And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a burnt offering unto the LORD: it is a sweet savour, an offering made <span class="anchor">by </span>fire unto the LORD. And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram. Then shalt thou kill the <span class="anchor">ram, </span>and take of his blood, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the <span class="anchor">thumb </span>of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about. And thou shalt take of the blood that is <span class="anchor">upon </span>the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he <span class="anchor">shall </span>be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons&apos; garments with him. Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat that covereth <span class="anchor">the </span>inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder; for it is a ram of consecration: And one <span class="anchor">loaf </span>of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before the LORD: And thou shalt put all in the <span class="anchor">hands </span>of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons; and shalt wave them for a wave offering before the LORD. And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them <span class="anchor">upon </span>the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the LORD: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD. And thou shalt take the breast of the <span class="anchor">ram </span>of Aaron&apos;s consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD: and it shall be thy part. And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the <span class="anchor">shoulder </span>of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for <span class="anchor">his </span>sons: And it shall be Aaron&apos;s and his sons&apos; by a statute for ever from the children of Israel: for it is an heave offering: and it shall be an heave <span class="anchor">offering </span>from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave offering unto the LORD. And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons&apos; after him, <span class="anchor">to </span>be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them. And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of <span class="anchor">the </span>congregation to minister in the holy place. And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh in the holy place. And Aaron and his sons shall eat <span class="anchor">the </span>flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was <span class="anchor">made, </span>to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy. And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread, remain <span class="anchor">unto </span>the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy. And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according <span class="anchor">to </span>all things which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them. And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse <span class="anchor">the </span>altar, when thou hast made an atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it. Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and <span class="anchor">it </span>shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy. Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day <span class="anchor">by </span>day continually. The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even: And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled <span class="anchor">with </span>the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering. And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, <span class="anchor">and </span>shalt do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD. This <span class="anchor">shall </span>be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee. And <span class="anchor">there </span>I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory. And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: I will <span class="anchor">sanctify </span>also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest&apos;s office. And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God. And they shall <span class="anchor">know </span>that I am the LORD their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am the LORD their God.</p><h2>Chapter 30</h2><p>And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim wood shalt thou make it. A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare <span class="anchor">shall </span>it be: and two cubits shall be the height thereof: the horns thereof shall be of the same. And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the <span class="anchor">sides </span>thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about. And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown <span class="anchor">of </span>it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make it; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal. And thou <span class="anchor">shalt </span>make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold. And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat <span class="anchor">that </span>is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee. And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it. And <span class="anchor">when </span>Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations. Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, <span class="anchor">nor </span>meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon. And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering <span class="anchor">of </span>atonements: once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it is most holy unto the LORD. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, When thou takest <span class="anchor">the </span>sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that there be no <span class="anchor">plague </span>among them, when thou numberest them. This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel is <span class="anchor">twenty </span>gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD. Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto <span class="anchor">the </span>LORD. The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD, to make an atonement for <span class="anchor">your </span>souls. And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a <span class="anchor">memorial </span>unto the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and <span class="anchor">his </span>foot also of brass, to wash withal: and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein. For Aaron and his <span class="anchor">sons </span>shall wash their hands and their feet thereat: When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near <span class="anchor">to </span>the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD: So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a <span class="anchor">statute </span>for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations. Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh <span class="anchor">five </span>hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels, And of cassia five hundred shekels, after <span class="anchor">the </span>shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin: And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall <span class="anchor">be </span>an holy anointing oil. And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony, And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and <span class="anchor">his </span>vessels, and the altar of incense, And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver and his foot. And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be <span class="anchor">most </span>holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy. And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that they may minister unto me in the priest&apos;s office. And thou shalt <span class="anchor">speak </span>unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations. Upon man&apos;s flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any <span class="anchor">other </span>like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it shall be holy unto you. Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, <span class="anchor">shall </span>even be cut off from his people. And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each <span class="anchor">shall </span>there be a like weight: And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together, pure and holy: And thou shalt beat some of <span class="anchor">it </span>very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy. And as for <span class="anchor">the </span>perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto thee holy for the LORD. Whosoever shall make like unto that, <span class="anchor">to </span>smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people.</p><h2>Chapter 31</h2><p>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah: And I have filled <span class="anchor">him </span>with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship, To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and <span class="anchor">in </span>brass, And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship. And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the <span class="anchor">son </span>of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee; <span class="anchor">The </span>tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle, And the table and his furniture, and <span class="anchor">the </span>pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense, And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and his foot, And the cloths of <span class="anchor">service, </span>and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest&apos;s office, And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy place: <span class="anchor">according </span>to all that I have commanded thee shall they do. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall <span class="anchor">keep: </span>for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you. Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; <span class="anchor">for </span>it is holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his <span class="anchor">people. </span>Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be <span class="anchor">put </span>to death. Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. It is a sign between me and the children <span class="anchor">of </span>Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed. And he gave unto Moses, when he had <span class="anchor">made </span>an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.</p><h2>Chapter 32</h2><p>And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which <span class="anchor">shall </span>go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. And Aaron said <span class="anchor">unto </span>them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me. And all the people brake <span class="anchor">off </span>the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron. And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made <span class="anchor">it </span>a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar <span class="anchor">before </span>it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD. And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; <span class="anchor">and </span>the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play. And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out <span class="anchor">of </span>the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves: They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, <span class="anchor">and </span>have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen <span class="anchor">this </span>people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people: Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make <span class="anchor">of </span>thee a great nation. And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the <span class="anchor">land </span>of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand? Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and <span class="anchor">to </span>consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people. Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou <span class="anchor">swarest </span>by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto <span class="anchor">your </span>seed, and they shall inherit it for ever. And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people. And Moses turned, and went down from the <span class="anchor">mount, </span>and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written. And <span class="anchor">the </span>tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables. And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he <span class="anchor">said </span>unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp. And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of <span class="anchor">them </span>that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear. And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he <span class="anchor">saw </span>the calf, and the dancing: and Moses&apos; anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount. And he took the calf which <span class="anchor">they </span>had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it. And Moses said <span class="anchor">unto </span>Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?  And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou <span class="anchor">knowest </span>the people, that they are set on mischief. For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us <span class="anchor">up </span>out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off. So they gave <span class="anchor">it </span>me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf. And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto their <span class="anchor">shame </span>among their enemies:) Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD&apos;s side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi <span class="anchor">gathered </span>themselves together unto him. And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate <span class="anchor">to </span>gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour. And the children of Levi did according to the word of <span class="anchor">Moses: </span>and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his <span class="anchor">brother; </span>that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day. And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and <span class="anchor">now </span>I will go up unto the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin. And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great <span class="anchor">sin, </span>and have made them gods of gold. Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written. <span class="anchor">And </span>the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book. Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have <span class="anchor">spoken </span>unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them. And the LORD plagued the people, because they <span class="anchor">made </span>the calf, which Aaron made.</p><h2>Chapter 33</h2><p>And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I <span class="anchor">sware </span>unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it: And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the <span class="anchor">Amorite, </span>and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for <span class="anchor">thou </span>art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way. And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments. For <span class="anchor">the </span>LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: <span class="anchor">therefore </span>now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee. And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb. And <span class="anchor">Moses </span>took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which <span class="anchor">sought </span>the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp. And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that all the people <span class="anchor">rose </span>up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle. And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, <span class="anchor">the </span>cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses. And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door: and <span class="anchor">all </span>the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent door. And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned <span class="anchor">again </span>into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle. And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, <span class="anchor">Bring </span>up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace <span class="anchor">in </span>my sight. Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in <span class="anchor">thy </span>sight: and consider that this nation is thy people. And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest. And he said unto him, If thy <span class="anchor">presence </span>go not with me, carry us not up hence. For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? is it not in <span class="anchor">that </span>thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth. And the LORD said unto Moses, <span class="anchor">I </span>will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name. And he said, I beseech thee, shew me <span class="anchor">thy </span>glory. And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I <span class="anchor">will </span>be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy. And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live. And <span class="anchor">the </span>LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock: And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put <span class="anchor">thee </span>in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by: And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: <span class="anchor">but </span>my face shall not be seen.</p><h2>Chapter 34</h2><p>And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables, <span class="anchor">which </span>thou brakest. And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount. And no <span class="anchor">man </span>shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount. And he hewed two tables of <span class="anchor">stone </span>like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two <span class="anchor">tables </span>of stone. And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD. And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The <span class="anchor">LORD, </span>The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the <span class="anchor">guilty; </span>visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children&apos;s children, unto the third and to the fourth generation. And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward <span class="anchor">the </span>earth, and worshipped. And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD, let my LORD, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked <span class="anchor">people; </span>and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance. And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as <span class="anchor">have </span>not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the LORD: for it is a terrible <span class="anchor">thing </span>that I will do with thee. Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the <span class="anchor">Perizzite, </span>and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in <span class="anchor">the </span>midst of thee: But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves: For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, <span class="anchor">is </span>a jealous God: Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and one call <span class="anchor">thee, </span>and thou eat of his sacrifice; And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring <span class="anchor">after </span>their gods. Thou shalt make thee no molten gods. The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time <span class="anchor">of </span>the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt. All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that <span class="anchor">is </span>male. But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the firstborn of thy sons <span class="anchor">thou </span>shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty. Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest. <span class="anchor">And </span>thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year&apos;s end. Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear <span class="anchor">before </span>the LORD God, the God of Israel. For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go <span class="anchor">up </span>to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year. Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the <span class="anchor">passover </span>be left unto the morning. The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in <span class="anchor">his </span>mother&apos;s milk. And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel. And he <span class="anchor">was </span>there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments. <span class="anchor">And </span>it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses&apos; hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not <span class="anchor">that </span>the skin of his face shone while he talked with him. And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they <span class="anchor">were </span>afraid to come nigh him. And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them. And afterward all the <span class="anchor">children </span>of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai. And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put <span class="anchor">a </span>vail on his face. But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake <span class="anchor">unto </span>the children of Israel that which he was commanded. And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses&apos; face shone: and Moses put the vail <span class="anchor">upon </span>his face again, until he went in to speak with him.</p><h2>Chapter 35</h2><p>And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said unto them, These are the words which the LORD hath commanded, that ye should do them. Six <span class="anchor">days </span>shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whosoever doeth work therein shall be put <span class="anchor">to </span>death. Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day. And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which <span class="anchor">the </span>LORD commanded, saying, Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD; gold, and silver, <span class="anchor">and </span>brass, And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats&apos; hair, And rams&apos; skins dyed red, and badgers&apos; skins, and shittim wood, And oil for the light, and spices <span class="anchor">for </span>anointing oil, and for the sweet incense, And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for the breastplate. And every wise hearted among you shall come, and <span class="anchor">make </span>all that the LORD hath commanded; The tabernacle, his tent, and his covering, his taches, and his boards, his bars, his pillars, and his sockets, The ark, and the staves thereof, <span class="anchor">with </span>the mercy seat, and the vail of the covering, The table, and his staves, and all his vessels, and the shewbread, The candlestick also for the light, and his furniture, and <span class="anchor">his </span>lamps, with the oil for the light, And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entering <span class="anchor">in </span>of the tabernacle, The altar of burnt offering, with his brasen grate, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot, The hangings of the court, his pillars, and <span class="anchor">their </span>sockets, and the hanging for the door of the court, The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords, The cloths of service, to do service <span class="anchor">in </span>the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest&apos;s office. And all the congregation of the children of Israel <span class="anchor">departed </span>from the presence of Moses. And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD&apos;s offering to the <span class="anchor">work </span>of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his service, and for the holy garments. And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted, and brought <span class="anchor">bracelets, </span>and earrings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold: and every man that offered offered an offering of gold unto the LORD. And every man, with whom was found blue, <span class="anchor">and </span>purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats&apos; hair, and red skins of rams, and badgers&apos; skins, brought them. Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought <span class="anchor">the </span>LORD&apos;s offering: and every man, with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought it. And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their <span class="anchor">hands, </span>and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen. And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom <span class="anchor">spun </span>goats&apos; hair. And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate; And spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing <span class="anchor">oil, </span>and for the sweet incense. The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of <span class="anchor">work, </span>which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses. And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath called by name Bezaleel the son <span class="anchor">of </span>Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner <span class="anchor">of </span>workmanship; And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of wood, to <span class="anchor">make </span>any manner of cunning work. And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. Them hath <span class="anchor">he </span>filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and <span class="anchor">in </span>fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that devise cunning work.</p><h2>Chapter 36</h2><p>Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of <span class="anchor">the </span>sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had commanded. And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one <span class="anchor">whose </span>heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it: And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of <span class="anchor">the </span>service of the sanctuary, to make it withal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning. And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, <span class="anchor">came </span>every man from his work which they made; And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded <span class="anchor">to </span>make. And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. <span class="anchor">So </span>the people were restrained from bringing. For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much. And every wise hearted man among them that <span class="anchor">wrought </span>the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them. The length of one curtain <span class="anchor">was </span>twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size. And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other <span class="anchor">five </span>curtains he coupled one unto another. And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side <span class="anchor">of </span>another curtain, in the coupling of the second. Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling <span class="anchor">of </span>the second: the loops held one curtain to another. And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle. <span class="anchor">And </span>he made curtains of goats&apos; hair for the tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them. The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the breadth <span class="anchor">of </span>one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size. And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves. And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of <span class="anchor">the </span>curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second. And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together, <span class="anchor">that </span>it might be one. And he made a covering for the tent of rams&apos; skins dyed red, and a covering of badgers&apos; skins above that. And he made boards for the <span class="anchor">tabernacle </span>of shittim wood, standing up. The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half. One board had two tenons, equally distant <span class="anchor">one </span>from another: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle. And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward: And forty sockets of <span class="anchor">silver </span>he made under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons. And for the other side of <span class="anchor">the </span>tabernacle, which is toward the north corner, he made twenty boards, And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board. And for the <span class="anchor">sides </span>of the tabernacle westward he made six boards. And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides. And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together <span class="anchor">at </span>the head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners. And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver, under <span class="anchor">every </span>board two sockets. And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle, And five bars for the boards of the other side <span class="anchor">of </span>the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward. And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to <span class="anchor">the </span>other. And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold. And he made a vail <span class="anchor">of </span>blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubims made he it of cunning work. And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold: <span class="anchor">their </span>hooks were of gold; and he cast for them four sockets of silver. And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined <span class="anchor">linen, </span>of needlework; And the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their chapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five sockets were of brass.</p><h2>Chapter 37</h2><p>And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit <span class="anchor">and </span>a half the height of it: And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about. And he cast for it <span class="anchor">four </span>rings of gold, to be set by the four corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings upon the other side of it. And <span class="anchor">he </span>made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold. And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark. And he made <span class="anchor">the </span>mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half was the length thereof, and one cubit and a half the breadth thereof. And he made two cherubims of gold, beaten <span class="anchor">out </span>of one piece made he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat; One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the other end on that <span class="anchor">side: </span>out of the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof. And the cherubims spread out their wings on high, and covered with their wings over the mercy <span class="anchor">seat, </span>with their faces one to another; even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims. And he made the table of shittim wood: two cubits was the length thereof, <span class="anchor">and </span>a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof: And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereunto a crown of gold round about. Also <span class="anchor">he </span>made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about; and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about. And he cast for it four rings of gold, and <span class="anchor">put </span>the rings upon the four corners that were in the four feet thereof. Over against the border were the rings, the places for the staves to bear the table. And he <span class="anchor">made </span>the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table. And he made the vessels which were upon the table, his dishes, and his spoons, and his <span class="anchor">bowls, </span>and his covers to cover withal, of pure gold. And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made he the candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, <span class="anchor">his </span>knops, and his flowers, were of the same: And six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches <span class="anchor">of </span>the candlestick out of the other side thereof: Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in <span class="anchor">another </span>branch, a knop and a flower: so throughout the six branches going out of the candlestick. And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, his knops, and his flowers: <span class="anchor">And </span>a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches <span class="anchor">going </span>out of it. Their knops and their branches were of the same: all of it was one beaten work of pure gold. And he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, <span class="anchor">and </span>his snuffdishes, of pure gold. Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels thereof. And he made the incense altar of shittim wood: the length of <span class="anchor">it </span>was a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; it was foursquare; and two cubits was the height of it; the horns thereof were of the same. And he overlaid <span class="anchor">it </span>with pure gold, both the top of it, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: also he made unto it a crown of gold round about. And <span class="anchor">he </span>made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof, by the two corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be places for the staves to bear it <span class="anchor">withal. </span>And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold. And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of sweet spices, according to the work <span class="anchor">of </span>the apothecary.</p><h2>Chapter 38</h2><p>And he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood: five cubits was the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth thereof; it was foursquare; and three cubits the height <span class="anchor">thereof. </span>And he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; the horns thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass. And he made all the vessels <span class="anchor">of </span>the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and the basons, and the fleshhooks, and the firepans: all the vessels thereof made he of brass. And he made for the altar a <span class="anchor">brasen </span>grate of network under the compass thereof beneath unto the midst of it. And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass, to be places for <span class="anchor">the </span>staves. And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with brass. And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar, to bear it <span class="anchor">withal; </span>he made the altar hollow with boards. And he made the laver of brass, and the foot of it of brass, of the lookingglasses of the women assembling, which assembled at <span class="anchor">the </span>door of the tabernacle of the congregation. And he made the court: on the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, an hundred cubits: Their <span class="anchor">pillars </span>were twenty, and their brasen sockets twenty; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver. And for the north side the hangings were an hundred cubits, their pillars <span class="anchor">were </span>twenty, and their sockets of brass twenty; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver. And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten, and <span class="anchor">their </span>sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver. And for the east side eastward fifty cubits. The hangings of the one side of the gate were fifteen <span class="anchor">cubits; </span>their pillars three, and their sockets three. And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and that hand, were hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and <span class="anchor">their </span>sockets three. All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined linen. And the sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their <span class="anchor">fillets </span>of silver; and the overlaying of their chapiters of silver; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver. And the hanging for the gate of the court was <span class="anchor">needlework, </span>of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and twenty cubits was the length, and the height in the breadth was five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the <span class="anchor">court. </span>And their pillars were four, and their sockets of brass four; their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their chapiters and their fillets of silver. And all the pins of <span class="anchor">the </span>tabernacle, and of the court round about, were of brass. This is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment <span class="anchor">of </span>Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaron the priest. And Bezaleel the son Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, <span class="anchor">made </span>all that the LORD commanded Moses. And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and <span class="anchor">in </span>purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen. All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of the holy place, even the gold of the offering, was <span class="anchor">twenty </span>and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary. And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was an hundred talents, and <span class="anchor">a </span>thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary: A bekah for every man, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for <span class="anchor">every </span>one that went to be numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men. And of the hundred talents of <span class="anchor">silver </span>were cast the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundred sockets of the hundred talents, a talent for a socket. And of the thousand seven hundred <span class="anchor">seventy </span>and five shekels he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and filleted them. And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred <span class="anchor">shekels. </span>And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the brasen altar, and the brasen grate for it, and all the vessels of the <span class="anchor">altar, </span>And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about.</p><h2>Chapter 39</h2><p>And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded <span class="anchor">Moses. </span>And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to <span class="anchor">work </span>it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, with cunning work. They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together: by the <span class="anchor">two </span>edges was it coupled together. And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of the same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and purple, and <span class="anchor">scarlet, </span>and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded Moses. And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children of <span class="anchor">Israel. </span>And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses. And he made <span class="anchor">the </span>breastplate of cunning work, like the work of the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span <span class="anchor">was </span>the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being doubled. And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: <span class="anchor">this </span>was the first row. And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond. And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst. And the fourth row, a <span class="anchor">beryl, </span>an onyx, and a jasper: they were inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings. And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to <span class="anchor">their </span>names, like the engravings of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes. And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of wreathen work of <span class="anchor">pure </span>gold. And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate. And they put the two wreathen chains <span class="anchor">of </span>gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate. And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two ouches, and put them on the <span class="anchor">shoulderpieces </span>of the ephod, before it. And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the <span class="anchor">side </span>of the ephod inward. And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the other <span class="anchor">coupling </span>thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod. And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might <span class="anchor">be </span>above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses. And he made the robe of the ephod <span class="anchor">of </span>woven work, all of blue. And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it <span class="anchor">should </span>not rend. And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen. And they made bells of pure gold, and put the <span class="anchor">bells </span>between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates; A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe <span class="anchor">to </span>minister in; as the LORD commanded Moses. And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons, And a mitre of fine linen, and goodly <span class="anchor">bonnets </span>of fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen, And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses. And <span class="anchor">they </span>made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD. And they tied unto <span class="anchor">it </span>a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon the mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses. Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation <span class="anchor">finished: </span>and the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they. And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all his furniture, his <span class="anchor">taches, </span>his boards, his bars, and his pillars, and his sockets, And the covering of rams&apos; skins dyed red, and the covering of badgers&apos; skins, and the vail of the covering, The <span class="anchor">ark </span>of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy seat, The table, and all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread, The pure candlestick, with the lamps thereof, even with the <span class="anchor">lamps </span>to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for light, And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for <span class="anchor">the </span>tabernacle door, The brasen altar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot, The hangings of the court, his pillars, and his sockets, <span class="anchor">and </span>the hanging for the court gate, his cords, and his pins, and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of the congregation, The cloths of service <span class="anchor">to </span>do service in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons&apos; garments, to minister in the priest&apos;s office. According to all that the LORD commanded <span class="anchor">Moses, </span>so the children of Israel made all the work. And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had <span class="anchor">they </span>done it: and Moses blessed them.</p><h2>Chapter 40</h2><p>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. And thou shalt put <span class="anchor">therein </span>the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail. And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in <span class="anchor">order </span>upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof. And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, <span class="anchor">and </span>put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle. And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. <span class="anchor">And </span>thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein. And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up <span class="anchor">the </span>hanging at the court gate. And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and <span class="anchor">it </span>shall be holy. And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy. And thou <span class="anchor">shalt </span>anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it. And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water. <span class="anchor">And </span>thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest&apos;s office. And thou shalt bring his sons, and <span class="anchor">clothe </span>them with coats: And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest&apos;s office: for their anointing shall surely be an <span class="anchor">everlasting </span>priesthood throughout their generations. Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he. And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, <span class="anchor">on </span>the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up. And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in <span class="anchor">the </span>bars thereof, and reared up his pillars. And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses. <span class="anchor">And </span>he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark: And he brought the ark into <span class="anchor">the </span>tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses. And he put the table in the tent of the <span class="anchor">congregation, </span>upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail. And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses. And he put <span class="anchor">the </span>candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward. And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses. <span class="anchor">And </span>he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail: And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses. And he set up the hanging <span class="anchor">at </span>the door of the tabernacle. And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt <span class="anchor">offering </span>and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses. And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash withal. And <span class="anchor">Moses </span>and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat: When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; <span class="anchor">as </span>the LORD commanded Moses. And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work. <span class="anchor">Then </span>a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because <span class="anchor">the </span>cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all <span class="anchor">their </span>journeys: But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up. For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle <span class="anchor">by </span>day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.</p></body></html>
