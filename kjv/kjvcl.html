Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth. <span class="anchor">For </span>I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth. I have no greater joy than to hear <span class="anchor">that </span>my children walk in truth. Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers; Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou <span class="anchor">bring </span>forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well: Because that for his name&apos;s sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles. We therefore ought to receive <span class="anchor">such, </span>that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth. I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not. Wherefore, if I come, I <span class="anchor">will </span>remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them <span class="anchor">out </span>of the church. Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God. <span class="anchor">Demetrius </span>hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true. I had many things to write, <span class="anchor">but </span>I will not with ink and pen write unto thee: But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends <span class="anchor">salute </span>thee. Greet the friends by name.</p></body></html>
