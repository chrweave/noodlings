And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; And to knowledge <span class="anchor">temperance; </span>and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that <span class="anchor">ye </span>shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that <span class="anchor">he </span>was purged from his old sins. Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall: For so <span class="anchor">an </span>entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of <span class="anchor">these </span>things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth. Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting <span class="anchor">you </span>in remembrance; Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me. Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after <span class="anchor">my </span>decease to have these things always in remembrance. For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, <span class="anchor">but </span>were eyewitnesses of his majesty. For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved <span class="anchor">Son, </span>in whom I am well pleased. And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount. We have also a more sure word <span class="anchor">of </span>prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts: <span class="anchor">Knowing </span>this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God <span class="anchor">spake </span>as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</p><h2 id="chapter2">Chapter 2</h2><p>But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought <span class="anchor">them, </span>and bring upon themselves swift destruction. And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of. And through covetousness shall they <span class="anchor">with </span>feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not. For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast <span class="anchor">them </span>down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment; And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, <span class="anchor">bringing </span>in the flood upon the world of the ungodly; And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that <span class="anchor">after </span>should live ungodly; And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked: (For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from <span class="anchor">day </span>to day with their unlawful deeds;) The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished: But <span class="anchor">chiefly </span>them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities. Whereas angels, which are <span class="anchor">greater </span>in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord. But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that <span class="anchor">they </span>understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption; And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they <span class="anchor">are </span>and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you; Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have <span class="anchor">exercised </span>with covetous practices; cursed children: Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness; But <span class="anchor">was </span>rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man&apos;s voice forbad the madness of the prophet. These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom <span class="anchor">the </span>mist of darkness is reserved for ever. For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean <span class="anchor">escaped </span>from them who live in error. While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought <span class="anchor">in </span>bondage. For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter <span class="anchor">end </span>is worse with them than the beginning. For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from <span class="anchor">the </span>holy commandment delivered unto them. But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed <span class="anchor">to </span>her wallowing in the mire.</p><h2 id="chapter3">Chapter 3</h2><p>This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance: That ye may be mindful of the words which <span class="anchor">were </span>spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour: Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, <span class="anchor">walking </span>after their own lusts, And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation. <span class="anchor">For </span>this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water: Whereby the <span class="anchor">world </span>that then was, being overflowed with water, perished: But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day <span class="anchor">of </span>judgment and perdition of ungodly men. But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as <span class="anchor">one </span>day. The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to <span class="anchor">repentance. </span>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt <span class="anchor">with </span>fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up. Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to <span class="anchor">be </span>in all holy conversation and godliness, Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall <span class="anchor">melt </span>with fervent heat?  Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be <span class="anchor">diligent </span>that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless. And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according <span class="anchor">to </span>the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you; As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which <span class="anchor">they </span>that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction. Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being <span class="anchor">led </span>away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness. But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory <span class="anchor">both </span>now and for ever. Amen.</p><script>  var toggles = new Array(150).fill(0),  baseContent=new Array(150),  i;  for (i=0;i<150;i++){ var t="chapter"+i,  u=document.getElementById(t);  if(u!=null){ baseContent[i]=u.innerHTML; } } const z = document.getElementsByTagName("h1"); function bookAlert(x){  var m = "chapter" + x, n = "z" + x, y=document.getElementById(m), k = y.innerHTML; toggles[x]^=1; if(toggles[x]==1){ y.innerHTML = "<div style=\"color:Red\">" + z[0].innerHTML + "</div> " + k;  } else { y.innerHTML=baseContent[x]; }	 } </script></body></html>
