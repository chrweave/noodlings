      Scouts&apos; Own for Cubs
      </h1>
      <p>This is a quick introduction to preparing Scouts&apos; Own services for Cub Scouts. &quot;Scouts&apos; Own&quot; services are typically deliverd as part of a camp out program, but they are appropriate for any scouting function in which cub scouts are expected to spend some time in reverence. </p>
      <h2>On My Honor, I will do my best to do my duty to God &hellip; A Scout is Reverent </h2>
      <p>The Scout Oath begins with the reverence that each scout promises to show. The Scout Law finishes with the requirement of reverence for all scouts. Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of the scouting movement, realized that Scoutsâ€™ hearts are uplifted when they are encouraged to engage with the divine in the way to which they have become accustomed.

         Of course, scouts bring several different faith perspectives to the movement. Many of these perspectives disagree on significant doctrinal points. /p>
      <p>However, Our goal is to help scouts grow into following the Scout Oath and the Scout Law.</p>
