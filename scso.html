    <h1>
        Scouts&apos; Own for Cubs
    </h1>
    <p>This is a quick introduction to preparing Scouts&apos; Own services for Cub Scouts. &quot;Scouts&apos; Own&quot; services are typically delivered as part of a camp out program, but they are appropriate for any scouting function in which cub scouts are expected to spend some time in reverence. </p>
    <h2>On My Honor, I will do my best to do my duty to God &hellip; A Scout is Reverent </h2>
    <p>The Scout Oath begins with the reverence that each scout promises to show. The Scout Law finishes with the requirement of reverence for all scouts. Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of the scouting movement, realized that Scoutsâ€™ hearts are uplifted when they are encouraged to engage with the divine in the way to which they have become accustomed. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scouts%27_Own">(See Wikipedia Article.)</a> Of course, scouts bring several different faith perspectives to the movement. Many of these perspectives disagree on significant doctrinal points. We should be sensitive to these differences since we do not want to make any scouts or scout families feel excluded. </p>
    <p>As scouters, our goal is to help scouts grow into following the Scout Oath and the Scout Law. Usefully, to my knowledge, there is no spiritual tradition that actively discourages scout like conduct according to the Oath and Law. We can therefore wrap the Scout&apos;s Own service around encouraging scouts to better follow the Oath and Law in the context of their respective traditions. To that end, it is worth exploring different traditions&apos; texts in order to discover contributing material.  When introducing a text, song, or prayer from a particualr tradition, it helps scouts&apos; sense of orientation if the tradition is introduced first. Thus, If I am going ot pen a service with a blessing from the Christian, Catholic, tradition, I might introduce it thus: </p>
    <blockquote>
        From the Christian, Catholic tradition let us pray that our intentions be pure: <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collect_for_Purity">Almighty God, unto whom all hearts be open, all desires known, and from whom no secretes are hid: cleanse the thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration of thy Holy Spirit, that we may perfectly love thee, and worthily magnify thy holy name: through Christ our Lord. Amen.</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I would enbcourage you to draw inspirational material from your own tradition. However, if you know that a scouts are from a different tradition, It would help them to feel included if you specifically metion their traditions. Additionally, it wil help scouts better tolerate the religious diversity that they will see as they grow in the program if you can include references to traditions that may be entirely foreign. One of the most beautiful Scouts&apos; Own service in which I have participated had readings from the Hebrew Bible, the Christian Bible, The Qur&aops;an, Lakota sayings, and </p> 
    <p> There are a few things that we want do to get scouts engaged and keep them engaged with the ceremony. First, it needs to be short. Readings from scripture should be no more than 1-2 minutes. One of my favorites is the Fruits of the Spirit passage from the Christian Bible, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5&version=NIV">Galatians 5:22 &amp; 23 (NIV):</a>
        <blockquote>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. </blockquote> 
            This is only two verses, but it provides a scriptural hook for a possible homily on trustworthiness, kindness or cheerfulness. </p>
    <p>Homilies should also be short. For Troop aged scouts, I would recommend no more than 10 minutes. For Cubs, it should be no more than five minutes. I would encourage songs, but no more than one verse. And songs should be simple so that scouts will be able to follow and participate.</p>
    <p>The second recommendation that I have for keeping Cubs engaged, is to allow them to participate in the service as much as possible. Troop scouts maybe content to sit quietly and listen, but I have found that Cubs get the wiggles if they are not saying or doing something as part of the service. The Reformed tradition in Christianity has a prayer rubric that may be helpful in structuring a service so that Cubs can participate on an individual level. It is called ACTS for the clever acrostic reference to the Christian Bible. It consists of Adoration Confession Thanksgiving, and Supplication. </p>
    <h2> Example ACTS </h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Adoration </strong> </li>
        <li><strong>Confession</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Thanksgiving</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>Supplication</strong></li>
    </ul>
