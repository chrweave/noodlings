      Scouts&apos; Own for Cubs
      <p>This is a quick introduction to preparing Scouts’ Own services for Cub scouts on camp outs. </p>
      <h2>On My Honor, I will do my best to do my duty to God … A Scout is Reverent </h2>
      <p>The Scout Oath begins with the reverence that each scout promises to show. The Scout Law finishes with the requirement of reverence for all scouts. Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of the scouting movement, realized that Scouts’ hearts are uplifted when they are encouraged to engage with the divine in the way to which they have become accustomed. Of course, scouts bring many different faith perspectives to the movement. Many of these perspectives disagree on significant theological points. ,/p>
      <p>However, Our goal is to help scouts grow into folllowing the Scout Oath and the Scout Law.</p>
